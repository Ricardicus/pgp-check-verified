# Are you real?

Maybe you are a bot. In the real-people-pgp organization, we only sign PGP keys 
that belong to people we have met in real life. If anyone is sharing their PGP key,
you might want to check if they are at least a real person.

# Do you want your key signed? 

Contact me at rickard.hallerback@gmail.com or get in contact any other of our 
CA authorities you can find on Github in the readme here: https://github.com/real-people-pgp/real-people-pgp.
